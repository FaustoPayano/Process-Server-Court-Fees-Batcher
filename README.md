# Process-Server-Court-Fees-Batcher
A tool developed to maximize efficiency when receiving files from the process server. The files are broken down into objects and then output in an efficient format for use in our system.

This is one of various programs designed to increase the efficiency of some daily tasks. A formerly time consuming task has been broken down with a program that produces easier to use results that get implemented in our system ahead of schedule.

Each file opened in the listbox can be clicked to open up its corresponding court fee file.
